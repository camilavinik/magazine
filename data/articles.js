      "There are more and more parks dedicated to our dogs, areas designed 100% for them and their enjoyment, but are they for all dogs? We tell you the most common mistakes that owners make. <br> <br> <strong>1. Release the dog as soon as they enter.</strong> <br> Our pet can get too excited when we start to approach the park, an overly excited dog gets nervous and can end up fighting with the other dogs in the place. <br> <br> What should I do then? We must try to change the paths we take so that it does not identify our routine, and when we arrive at the park we will take a few minutes to reassure our pet. <br> <br> <strong>2. Bring our dog in heat.</strong> <br> It seems obvious but it is not for many, some certain phases of our pet's heat can end in aggressive behavior towards the rest of the dogs in the park, or generate disputes between the other dogs because they will fight for it. <br> <br> We can go during the last stage of our pet's heat since neither she is aggressive nor are the other dogs interested in her, but we must always take into account the supervision and care of everyone for this.<br> <br> <strong> 3. Bringing toys or food to the park </strong> <br> It is quite common to see owners bring treats to their beloved puppies or even their favorite toys. The problem with this is that some dogs can be selfish with their things, protecting their food or their toys. <br> <br> This again can lead to conflicts with other dogs. <br> For this reason we have to avoid bringing toys and when we want to give him some food, separate him and feed him in private. <br> Also, we should never feed a dog that is not our own, much less without asking beforehand. <br> <br>",
