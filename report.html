    <h1>Report</h1>
    <h1>Camila Sánchez</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The newspaper I developed was inspired by magazine sites and blogs. I
      wanted to create a magazine, but give it the freshness of a blog, with
      transparency and a relation between the reader and the writer. I came with
      the idea of building <strong>WE LOVE PETS</strong> as my cat recently went
      missing and I got really envolved with the pet community of my local
      neighbourhood. My cat is finally home and I’ve developed a magazine for
      the pets lovers community.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Magazine or newspaper display</strong>
      <br />
      I felt it was the best way to show all the articles at the home page, as
      they show multiple articles with captive titles and descriptions. Also the
      way they suggest you similar articles while you read inspired me to do a
      similar behavior. For this I took inspiration from two specific newspaper
      designs which I found both completely eye-catching.

        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. Blogs transparency</strong>
      <br />
      I love the way blogs function, how you really trust the person behind all
      the articles and go there to take decisions about anything you want. That
      is the same relation I wanted for this website, so I chose to have an
      informal subject as ‘pets’ and write relatable articles which don’t feel
      like the common news you will find on a newspaper or magazine.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>3. About and Contact</strong>
      <br />
      Lastly, the <strong>about us</strong> and
      <strong>contact</strong> sections where bost inspired by how nowadays
      companies manage to have contact with potential clients or employees. That
      is why I decided to add both sections on the website. The
      <strong>about us</strong> page has it role for knowing what kind of
      company and vision we have, for potentially attract people who wants to
      help by working or investing here. And the <strong>contact</strong> page
      make it's role for making this contact a realthing, everyone who whant to
      say something can simply complete a form. This form is not currently
      working as it would need a backend integration, but the structure is
      prepared to handle that as soon as something like that is added. But
      unfortunately that last exceeded the course and time proposed.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. The site is fully navigable using the keyboard</strong>
      <br />
      There is no functionality loose by using just the tab, shift and enter
      keys of the boards. So users without a mouse can still have the whole
      experience. This was achieved by using correct HTML tags specially in
      forms, and a structured HTML.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. Sightless users can still enjoy the website</strong>
      <br />
      The website was prepared for sightless users by using according tags, the
      pages have a solid structure and every image has a descriptive alt, which
      is something particularly required when creating an article.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>3. Multiple screens support</strong>
      <br />
      The website support every screen size from phone to wide desktop screen,
      to ensure different user have a pleasant time. The use of CSS media
      queries ensure that different users can have an according display in their
      screens.
    </p>
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Use of Navbar and suggested articles</strong>
      <br />
      The navbar is a key component for the page usability, as it enables the
      user to navigate across the whole page with an easy access from everywhere
      (as the nabber is always present). The only inaccessible page are the
      article, which they are in the main page and its enough to click on them
      to go directly to its page, also I have included suggested articles in
      every article page, so going from one to another is very easy. Thinking of
      the link, I also created a “not found” page in case you intend to go to an
      article which doesn’t exists anymore, and in which the page suggests you
      to go back to home.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. Search bar</strong>
      <br />
      Okay but what happens if I want a specific article type or subject? The
      searcher is there for that, I have included tags for every article and
      that is how the search works, if an article have a tag that contains the
      same text as what it was searched, it will be shown on the search results
      page. So the user don’t have to specifically see the article on the
      homepage or in the suggested or another article, it can directly search
      for what he wants.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>3. Design</strong>
      <br />
      Lastly design is important for the user to have a nice experience in our
      page, I got inspired by different dribble magazine and newspaper examples,
      and searched for palettes and font which are commonly related with news
      websites and added some css animation for more interactiveness. Using
      headers, colors, fonts, spacing and animations correctly make the page
      more user friendly and intuitive to navigate through.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. JSON import</strong>
      <br />
      This idea will also be covered later in the evaluation section,
      <br />
      As part of the project, importing JSON files to the javascript code was
      part of the key code for creating a website, as it was the best way to
      simulate an API call. After multiple efforts on trying to implement an
      import on javascript (something I was used to working with React) I came
      across with the fact that that was not possible without a server or using
      a library, as it was continuously giving me CORS errors. This is something
      that made me re think the strategy for this implementation, and I got to
      know the scope of a webapp without a server. I finally solve that problem
      with a different strategy, importing a javascript file in the HTLM with
      the JSON as an object, but I got to learn the impact of servers and how
      much working with React changed things.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. Handlebars</strong>
      <br />
      Although this library was shown in the course, I still got to practice
      with it and try multiple times after I finally got it working in a way I
      was comfortable with. At first it felt like I was using more code that I
      would just inserting the HTML from vanilla javascript, plus the HTML was
      not being as readable as I wanted it to be, but after multiple YouTube
      videos, the Handlebars documentation and some creativity, I came to a
      solution were I found the value of using it. I didn’t create a container
      for where the template was going to be rendered and instead, I used the
      same parent container containing the script with the template, this helped
      me understand better the code as I was feeling that the HTML was not
      clearing enough having the script tag and the destination container
      separated.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>3. Device test</strong>
      <br />
      Device testing when working for mobile accessible website I something I
      learned and found it utility. The problem came when working using chrome
      tools with mobile sizes the webpage worked just fine, but after deploying
      with Coursera and opening it from an actual phone, some features (more
      specifically the banners) where broken, they were too large for the phone
      screen size. I here discovered two things, the importance of testing with
      the deployed webpage and the correct device, and that I needed something
      more likely to a phone than Google Chrome to help me develop, as the only
      way to investigate this issue was on the deployed version on the phone and
      redeploying was too much work for just debugging.I then find the utility
      of working with Xcode, this app is usually used for developing IOS apps,
      but was completely useful for testing also website as it offered iPhone
      simulators, and using these really helped me solve the issue quickly. I
      opened the safari app on these simulators and opened the project, I was
      able to find the issue and instantly see my code changes when refreshing,
      like in web Google Chrome.
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
      I think that the most successful part of the website is it
      <strong>scalability</strong>, from the beginning the whole website was
      intended to have new articles everyday, that is why I didn’t want every
      article to have it own HTML file adapted to the article need.
      <br />
      <br />
      Instead I created a data folder where you can find the articles.js file,
      this file have all the articles shown with a solid structure to enable
      correct display, accessibility and usability of the page. So whenever I
      want to add an article I just need to insert it in the array with all the
      properties listed in the other ones and that’s it. Is much more easier for
      non-programmers (and programmers too) to add articles this way, and fill
      the website with as much articles it wants.
      <br />
      <br />
      Also this way of fetching articles from a constant, is simulating an API
      response so later in the future an API can be created to fetch and create
      articles in a much more simpler way, even opening up the possibility to
      upload articles from the same page. Also the the search and suggested
      articles feature use this same array to search for the article needed,
      which in the case of using an API can be way more efficient than now (that
      is searching in an array in our front-end).
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <strong>1. Usage of articles.js</strong>
    <br />
    I really don’t like the solution I used for this, as the main idea was to
    use a JSON file which is a more accurate solution to what is needed, also I
    would have liked it to be imported from de JavaScript file. As this couldn’t
    be possible (explained in learning), I opted for adding a javascript file
    with an object, and importing it in the HTML.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although this was not the solution I would have wanted, was the best
    solution for the project sale and timing, so having a server and be able to
    make imports this way is definitely something I would like to improve in the
    future.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Recommended articles </strong>
    <br />
    Right know the recommended articles are a random selection of all the
    articles available in the page, as this is still a small project I found no
    need on doing a complex algorithm to recommend things based on similarity,
    but it is definitely something to improve as the page become wider and with
    more amount of articles.
    <br />
    <br />
    Improving this algorithm will lead directly in a better user experience
    which is something we are always interested in.
